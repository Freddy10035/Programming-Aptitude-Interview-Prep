Position Summary:
Software developers design programs across devices ranging from cell phones to televisions. Software can be developed in many forms, including games, applications,
or software programs. 
Software developers are in high demand due to the prevalence of software across all industries. 
There are many positions available as a software developer which can range from modifying code in individual programs to writing entirely new software systems.
 
 Q1) Can you describe the software development process you use?
Ans :- Explanation: This is an example of an opening or general question. 
 The interviewer will ask this type of question to begin a conversation, get you talking, find out a little bit more about you, and collect information 
 they can use for subsequent questions.
Example: “The software development process I use is the same one I learned early in my career and is very typical in the industry. 
 It begins with a requirement analysis which leads to the specifications and software architecture. 
 Once they are completed, I move on to development, implementation, testing, and documentation. 
 After this is done and the software is fully developed, my attention turns to training and support issues as well as ongoing maintenance and upgrades.”

Q2) In your opinion, what is the difference between computer software and a computer program?
Ans :- Explanation: An interviewer will ask this type of question to begin to explore your knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications for the job. 
 Knowing the distinction between these two standard terms is not that difficult but will indicate you are a viable candidate and convince the interviewer to 
 proceed with the interview.
Example: “Many people confuse these two terms. The way I define them is that a computer program is a set of code that executes specific tasks. 
 Computer software, on the other hand, is an application that performs a function for the end-user. Computer software contains computer programs. 
 Computer software is more user-centric, whereas computer programs are more machine-centric.”

Q3) What types of development projects have you worked on recently?
Ans :- Explanation: The reason an interviewer will ask this question is to determine if you’ve recently done the type of work for which they are interviewing you. 
 During the interview, your answers to an interviewer’s questions should address the needs of the employer. These are typically defined in the job posting. 
 You may also be able to determine these during your pre-interview research about the company, its products, and practices.
Example :- “Most recently, I have been working on OLTP applications. Since most of my career has been in the financial industry,   
 I began specializing in this type of programming. Areas I focus on are concurrency and atomicity. I have developed several sets of code around these functions 
 using a variety of different programming languages.”
 
Q4) Which design patterns do you use, and in what situations do you use them?
 Ans :- Explanation: This is an operational question. Interviewers ask operational questions to determine how you go about completing the tasks required by this role. 
  Operational questions are best responded to succinctly and directly with little embellishment. Additionally, you should always expect follow-up questions 
  when an interviewer is asking about a specific task.
 Example :- “During my software development career, I’ve tried many different design patterns. These include Singleton, MVC, and Template. 
  However, the one I prefer and use most often is Iterator. This helps me code in an organized fashion and reduces the amount of time to develop the software. 
  It also results in fewer errors and less debugging.”
  
  // Expect follow up questions like what is MVC, SIngleton and template.
  
Q5) What was the most challenging software development problem you have worked on, and how did it turn out?
 Ans :- Explanation: An interviewer will ask this question to gain an understanding of the scope of your experience and the type of projects you have worked on in the past. 
  The query is in the form of a behavioral question. You can respond to behavioral questions using the STAR framework. 
  State the Situation, define the Task you need to complete, discuss the Action you took, then describe the Results you attained.
 Example :- “The most challenging software project I’ve worked on recently involved an end-user application for managing team sports. 
  The challenge was that end-users had to have secure access to their own information without the ability to alter team or league data. 
  I had to develop the application on a short timeline and deploy it into a real-life scenario without a great deal of testing. 
  It also had to meet a price point which the market would accept. Recognizing that I did not have all the skills and experience necessary for this, I recruited 
  some additional developers, and we collaborated on the project. Together we were able to produce the software per the schedule and on budget.  
  This taught me to recognize my shortcomings and bring in additional resources when needed.”
  
 Q6) Tell me about the software development methodology you prefer?
 Ans :- Explanation: By asking this question, the interviewer is trying to determine if you are a good fit for their organization. 
  Software developers can choose from a lot of different methodologies, but when working on a team, they all need to use the same methodology. 
  Stating which methodology you use should be based on your pre-interview research. Your methodology should align with the one the company currently uses.
 Example: “The methodology I use most and prefer is Agile. The reason I like this iterative framework is there are daily stand-ups in which the team gets together 
  to discuss the day’s development goals and any issues we’ve encountered. The other reason I prefer to use Agile methodology is because errors are 
  identified and corrected at each stage of the process. This results in better quality software and less debugging at the end of the project.”
